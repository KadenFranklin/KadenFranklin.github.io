Some VERY EARLY websites I made...

The [first one](https://kadenfranklin.github.io/csci340lab1/) is about Fish Riddle Root. (randomly generated words determined the assignment)

The [second](https://kadenfranklin.github.io/csci340lab2/) was made about a week later. It was the first website I made that used an API.
